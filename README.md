## Introduction
This is a game patch for Madden 08 on PS2 that updates the game database to include the latest rosters, coaches, stadium names, franchise information like salary cap, contracts, and more! This also modifies the game to take in NCAA Football 06 files instead of NCAA 08. This allows users to use NCAA 06 NEXT mod with this game!

In addition TEXTURES for Teams, Uniforms, Fields, Menu UI, and more have been updated with the use of PCSX2 1.7+! This creates an realistic and modern game experience for players to enjoy!

## KNOWN BUGS!

Since this is a beta and we've only done limited testing, bugs may occur! Please let us know when you get them!

For users using NCAA Football 06 with 2021 rosters, it seems like the FIRST YEAR draft class may lead to game freezing or crashing. I've tried this on both Madden 06 and Madden 08, so it is not a patch problem but a roster problem that I can't seem to trace the issue down to. Other draft classes in Year 2+ work just fine. Hopefully 2022-23 NCAA rosters do not pose this problem.

Before moving forward, please make a save point prior to importing rosters!
